  Note that if both the set and the clear are present in one opcode, the clear will take precedence

  Note that the byte will be ordered (MSB first) 76543210 when it arrives in LCD/TFT - bit order is preserved
  
There are three states: clock high, clock low, set mosi. Really they're "clock phases"
